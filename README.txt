Global folder organization:
plots -> Most of the plots made for project1
	plots/trees -> This folder contains the complete phylogeny plot with presence/absence of glycosyl hydrolases and a plot of the CDS in the 30kb region and all the Blast plots of each individual gene type (GS1-2 and BRS), plus the CDS plots that are added next to the phylogeny of each gene.
	plots/substitution_subsets -> Folder with the matrix plot of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions
code -> This folder contains most of the code for this project, except for:
	RDP5_analysis/code -> Code to generate alignments for RDP5
	GS2_BRS_repeats/code -> Code to get an alignment of several GS2 and BRS and plot it
	motifs/code -> Code to retrieve motifs from GH70 genes in A. kunkeei
	add_species/code -> Code to generate a GH70 tree adding sequences from other species and to retrieve motifs from the added sequences
